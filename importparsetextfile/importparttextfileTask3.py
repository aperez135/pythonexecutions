The output in the previous step is one big string. In this task, you'll explore how you can split the string that contains the entire imported log file into a list of strings, one string per line.

Use the .split() method to perform this split and then display the result. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

Note that displaying .split() doesnâ€™t change what is stored in the text variable. Variable reassignment would be necessary if you want to store the result after splitting.

# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that contains the security log file

import_file = "login.txt"

# The `with` statement
# Use `open()` to import security log file and store it as a string

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store the result in a variable named `text`

  text = file.read()

# Display the contents of `text` split into separate lines 

print(text.split(","))
