In your organization, employee IDs are currently either four digits or five digits in length. In this task, you're given a four-digit numeric employee ID stored in a variable called employee_id. Convert this to a string format and store the result in the same variable. Later, you'll update this employee ID string so that it complies with a new standardized format.

Complete the following code. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value

employee_id = 4186

# Display the data type of `employee_id`

print(type(employee_id))

# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string

employee_id = str(employee_id)

# Display the data type of `employee_id` now

print(type(employee_id))
