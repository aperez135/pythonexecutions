Now you will also need to extract the first through the third characters in the device ID. So take a slice of the device ID. You can achieve this using bracket notation in Python. Then, display the slice to examine the result.

# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters

device_id = "r262c36"

# Extract the first through the third characters in `device_id` and display the result

print(device_id[0:2])
