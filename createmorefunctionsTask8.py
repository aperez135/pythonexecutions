# Task 8
# In this task, you'll use the value of login_analysis in a conditional statement. When the value of login_analysis is greater than or equal to 3, then the login activity will require further investigation, and an alert will be displayed. Incorporate this condition to complete the conditional statement in the code.
# Be sure to replace each ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.


# Define a function named `analyze_logins()` that takes in three parameters, `username`, `current_day_logins`, and `average_day_logins`

def analyze_logins(username, current_day_logins, average_day_logins):

    # Display a message about how many login attempts the user has made that day

    print("Current day login total for", username, "is", current_day_logins)

    # Display a message about average number of login attempts the user has made that day

    print("Average logins per day for", username, "is", average_day_logins)

    # Calculate the ratio of the logins made on the current day to the logins made on an average day, storing in a variable named `login_ratio`

    login_ratio = current_day_logins / average_day_logins

    # Return the ratio

    return login_ratio

# Call `analyze_logins() and store the output in a variable named `login_analysis`

login_analysis = analyze_logins("ejones", 9, 3)

# Conditional statement that displays an alert about the login activity if it's more than normal

if login_analysis >= 3:
    print("Alert! This account has more login activity than normal.")
