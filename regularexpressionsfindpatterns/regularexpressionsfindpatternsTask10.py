Now, all of the valid IP addresses have been extracted. The next step is to identify flagged IP addresses.

You're given a list of IP addresses that have been previously flagged for unusual activity, stored in a variable named flagged_addresses. When these addresses are encountered, they should be investigated further. This list is just for educational purposes and contains examples of private IP addresses that are found only within internal networks.

Display this list and examine what it contains by running the cell. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

# Assign `flagged_addresses` to a list of IP addresses that have been previously flagged for unusual activity

flagged_addresses = ["192.168.190.178", "192.168.96.200", "192.168.174.117", "192.168.168.144"]

# Display the contents of `flagged_addresses`

print(flagged_addresses)
