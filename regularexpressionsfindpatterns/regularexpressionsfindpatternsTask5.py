Now, the next task you're responsible for is analyzing a network security log file and determining which IP addresses have been flagged for unusual activity.

You're given the log file as a string stored in a variable named log_file. There are some invalid IP addresses in the log file due to issues in data collection. Your eventual goal is to use regular expressions to extract the valid IP addresses from the string.

Start by displaying the contents of the log_file to examine the details inside. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.
