It's a good idea to save important data in variables when programming. This allows for quick and easy tracking and reuse of information.

Store the output of the .index() method in a variable called ind, which is short for index. This index represents the position where the domain extension ".com" starts in the url. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell. Note that running this cell will not produce an output.
'''


# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of ".com" in `url` 

ind = url.index(".com")

print(ind)
