'''Now you'll move on to the next part of your task. Imagine that the characters in a device ID convey technical information about the device. You'll need to extract characters in specific positions from the device ID. Start off by extracting the fourth character.

The variable device_id represents a device ID containing alphanumeric characters; it's already stored as a string.

Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.'''

# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters

device_id = "r262c36"

# Extract the fourth character in `device_id` and display it

print(device_id[3])
