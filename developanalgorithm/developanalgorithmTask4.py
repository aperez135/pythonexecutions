As part of verifying a user's identity in the system, you'll need to check if the user is one of the approved users. Write a conditional statement that verifies if a given username is an element of the list of approved usernames. If it is, display "The user ______ is approved to access the system.". Otherwise, display "The user ______ is not approved to access the system.". Be sure to replace each ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Conditional statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, then display "The user ______ is approved to access the system."
# Otherwise display "The user ______ is not approved to access the system."
if username in approved_users:
    print("The username", username, "is approved to access the system.")
else:    
    print("The username", username, "is not approved to access the system.")
