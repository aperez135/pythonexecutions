It would also be helpful for users to receive messages when their username is not approved or their device ID is incorrect.

Add to the code by writing an elif statement. This elif statement should run when the username is part of the approved_users but the device_id doesn't match the corresponding device ID in the approved_devices. The statement should also display two messages conveying that information.

Be sure to replace each ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

(After you run the code once with a device_id of "4n482ts", you might want to explore what happens if you assign a different value to device_id.)

# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `device_id` to a device ID

device_id = "4n482ts"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# If statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, and if the element at `ind` in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`,
# then display a message that the username is approved,
# followed by a message that the user has the correct device

if username in approved_users and device_id == approved_devices[ind]:
    print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")
    print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)

# Elif statement
# Handles the case when `username` belongs to `approved_users` but element at `ind` in `approved_devices` does not match `device_id`,
# and displays two messages accordingly

elif username in approved_users and approved_devices[ind] != device_id:
    print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system, but", device_id, "is not their assigned device.")
