Your next step in creating the algorithm is to determine if a username and device ID correspond. To do this, write a conditional that checks if the username is an element of the approved_devices and if the device_id stored at the same index as username matches the device_id entered. You'll use the logical operator and to connect the two conditions. When both conditions evaluate to True, display a message that the username is approved and another message that the user has their assigned device. Be sure to replace each ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before you run the following cell.

# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames

approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`

approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

# Assign `username` to a username

username = "sgilmore"

# Assign `device_id` to a device ID

device_id = "4n482ts"

# Assign `ind` to the index of `username` in `approved_users`

ind = approved_users.index(username)

# Conditional statement
# If `username` belongs to `approved_users`, and if the device ID at `ind` in `approved_devices` matches `device_id`,
# then display a message that the username is approved,
# followed by a message that the user has the correct device


if username in approved_users and approved_devices[ind] == device_id:
    print("The username", username, "is approved to access the system.")
    print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)
